# Landing-page-project

In this exercise, I have created a lading page, I used html, css so get so. 

Most of the page structure I used the display flex method in css. 

I tried my best on this exercise and I did not end up as the one I had to create on the example, but I tried it and I hope to someday become a better developer.
